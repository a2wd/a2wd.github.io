										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To quote from Ju Gonçalves&#8217; excellent article on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9">https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9</a>), Functional programming should be your top priority right now. This is a sentiment echoed in Michael Church&#8217;s answer to the question &#8220;what do software developers wish they&#8217;d known in their 20s&#8221; (<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-over-know-now-that-they-wish-they-had-known-in-their-20s/answer/Michael-O-Church">http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-over-know-now-that-they-wish-they-had-known-in-their-20s/answer/Michael-O-Church</a>), namely that &#8220;functional programming [is] worth learning for the long term&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Why Functional Programming?</h2>
<p>Functional programming draws on mathematical principles and is very different to imperative/procedural, object-oriented programming, or any of a range of other programming styles.</p>
<p>Functional programming can be a lot more efficient than other forms of programming (<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2843393/application-development/functional-programming-tradeoffs-efficiency-learning-curve.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2843393/application-development/functional-programming-tradeoffs-efficiency-learning-curve.html</a>) and in theory should lead to smaller developer teams.</p>
<p>Even if you never use a pure functional programming language, the concepts are both very useful and widely adopted. You will probably be able to use functional programming concepts and techniques in your language of choice.</p>
<h2>Why Haskell?</h2>
<p>Functional programming is implemented in a range of other languages that aren&#8217;t purely functional, such as JavaScript, Erlang, Java v8+, Lisp, Ruby, while there are few purely functional languages (most notably, Miranda). Of these, Haskell is probably the best known pure functional programming language.</p>
<p>If you’re going to learn functional programming, why not go all the way and dive straight into a purely functional programming language?</p>
<h2>Learning it</h2>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>There are a number of good resources to learn functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Currently, Delft University of Technology offers a 6 week course that runs periodically through edX (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x">https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x</a>). This offers a comprehensive introduction to both functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is the book “Learn You A Haskell For Great Good” by Miran Lipovaca which can be bought or read online for free (<a href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/">http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Additionally, you can try it out online without downloading anything at a number of places, notable (<a href="https://tryhaskell.org/">https://tryhaskell.org/</a>) which offers a simple tutorial. When you are ready to dive in deeper, you can get the compiler source code or binaries from (<a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">https://www.haskell.org/platform/</a>).</p>
