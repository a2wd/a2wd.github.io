										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent project called on me to refresh my experience of working in perl. The task was to find the distance between two UK postcodes using Object-oriented Programming (OOP).</p>
<p>The following three files make up the code:</p>
<p><a title="A perl script to find the distance between two postcodes" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/postcode.pl">postcode.pl</a><br />
<a title="A perl module defining the postcode object used in postcode.pl" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/postcode.pm">postcode.pm</a><br />
<a title="A database of UK postcodes (out codes only) in CSV format" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/postcodes.csv">postcodes.csv</a></p>
<p>The perl script, <code>postcode.pl</code> takes input of two postcodes (spaces aren&#8217;t important either within the postcodes or between as I&#8217;ve used a <a title="A blog post on regular expressions" href="https://a2wd.github.io/8/">regular expression</a> to match them from the given command-line arguments) and returns the distance between the two in kilometers.</p>
<p>In this case I have used the <a title="The wikipedia article for the Haversine Law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">haversine law</a>, in contrast to my <a title="A blog post on coding in Visual Basic" href="http://www.a2wd.com/visual-basic-coding">previous work</a> in Visual Basic for Applications, which due to a rounding error in excel meant I had to drop back to <a title="The wikipedia article for Equirectangular Projections" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">Pythagoras&#8217; Law on Equiangular Projections</a></p>
<p>The usage is:</p>
<p><code>my $PostCode = new postcode(string $postcode1);<br />
my $distance = $PostCode-&gt;distanceTo(string $postcode2);</code></p>

<h2>Converting journey times to nodes in a traffic model</h2>
</div>
<div id="content">
<p>I had a large data set of points from a GPS device (Garmin Nuvi) which needed matching up to nodes in a traffic model. Unfortunately the points on the GPS neither occur at exact node coordinates nor do they always even fall along the actual path of the road <a href="http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/">(GPS can be accurate to only ~8m)</a></p>
<p>To sort this out, I used Pythagoras&#8217; theorem on equirectangular projections (I had initially hoped to use the more accurate spherical law of cosines, but excel introduced a rounding error, even when specifying variables as doubles</p>
<p>The code I came up with was as such:</p>
<p>x = (lon2-lon1) * Math.cos((lat1+lat2)/2);</p>
<p>y = (lat2-lat1);</p>
<p>d = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y) * R;</p>
<p>With lat/lon 1 being the GPS point and lat/lon 2 being the node in our model, I could pinpoint the distance to the nearest node from this and then find the closest GPS point to each node, marking that up as the relevant datapoint and using the marked datapoints to calculate journey times along the route</p>
