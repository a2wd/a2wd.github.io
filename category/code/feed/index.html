										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mythical man-month <em>by Frederick Brooks</em> is a now ancient classic on project management, with a focus on programming &amp; systems development. It has excellent advice on the subject which is mostly very relevant today.</p>
<p>Some of the main lessons I took away from this book are:</p>
<h2>Time estimates &amp; planning</h2>
<p>Time estimates in software projects are often out by a long way. This is in part because not enough time is given to testing. Frederick&#8217;s advice is that if a component takes X time to build, it will take 2X time to test, on it&#8217;s own. On top of that it will also need another 2X integration testing time in addition to around 2X planning time. This is to say that the original estimate of X is likely to be out by at least a factor of 5.</p>
<h2>Team setup</h2>
<p>Another issue is that the larger a team, the less productive per-member the team. A team of one will mean ideas, architecture, set-up, bugs and the like don&#8217;t ever need to be communicated. Conversely, a team of 100 needs 100 times as many interactions to communicate basic details. Communication time which could be spent working on the problems at hand.</p>
<p>Obviously, some projects will require larger teams, but there is a strong incentive to keep the teams lean. Specifically, in his book, Brooks makes a comparison to a surgical team with one lead architect, a &#8216;co-pilot&#8217;, two team members and a couple of secretaries to deal with the administration.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said for smaller, leaner teams.</p>
<h2>Project overrun</h2>
<p>When it looks like a project is over-running, project managers have a tendency to add more resource to the project. This in the end has the counter-productive outcome of taking the existing team off their current tasks to train up the new team-members in the project setup. This doesn&#8217;t solve the original problem and instead leads to more burnt man-hours.</p>
<p>The main lesson here is to add new team members early on and to trust the team to deliver later on.</p>
<h2>Higher level languages</h2>
<p>This was probably the most interesting section/takeaway. I was reading the 20th anniversary imprint of the book, itself now 10 years old. In it, Brooks talks about the incredible development gains made by adopting object-oriented programming languages (specifically, by moving to C++ instead of COBOL, ALGOL or Assembly).</p>
<p>With the subsequent increases in processing speeds, we will probably see similar improvements with functional programming. As per many recent medium articles (cf. <a href="https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53#.9oez8shnj">Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</a>), for many projects, OOP is creaking and straining. There are a lot of gains to be made from functional techniques.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Keeping teams lean can really help companies deliver projects on time and to-budget. This is not just true in I.T. but many other disciplines too, however, it is especially important in I.T. to keep as small as possible. This sounds very close to agile and something I am currently exploring in Robert Martin&#8217;s <strong>Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Fastclick.js</h1>
<p>An easy-win to improve UX responsiveness in mobile browsers</p>
<h2>Fastclick.js | <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick">https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick</a></h2>
<p>In mobile browsers, there is a perceptible 300ms delay between tapping and the click event firing. This is to allow for double-tapping and lends non-native apps a sluggish feel.</p>
<p>The financial times developed a solution to this problem, fastclick.js. This javascript places an event listener on the body element and intercepts the initial tap, triggering an immediate click event.</p>
<p>To use, the fastclick.js script must be included and the listener must be added to the body. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/fastclick.js" type="application/javascript"&gt;
&lt;script type="application/javascript"&gt;
// &lt;![CDATA[
window.addEventListener('load', function() { FastClick.attach(document.body) })
// ]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There are two caveats to this script:</p>
<p>1. This disables double-tap to zoom (by nature, it disables double taps but pinch-to-zoom is still possible).</p>
<p>2. Some older versions of iOS (earlier than v5.0) don’t allow touch event handlers to trigger focus on other elements (http://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/examples/focus.html).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To quote from Ju Gonçalves&#8217; excellent article on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9">https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9</a>), Functional programming should be your top priority right now. This is a sentiment echoed in Michael Church&#8217;s answer to the question &#8220;what do software developers wish they&#8217;d known in their 20s&#8221; (<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-over-know-now-that-they-wish-they-had-known-in-their-20s/answer/Michael-O-Church">http://www.quora.com/What-do-software-developers-age-30-and-over-know-now-that-they-wish-they-had-known-in-their-20s/answer/Michael-O-Church</a>), namely that &#8220;functional programming [is] worth learning for the long term&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Why Functional Programming?</h2>
<p>Functional programming draws on mathematical principles and is very different to imperative/procedural, object-oriented programming, or any of a range of other programming styles.</p>
<p>Functional programming can be a lot more efficient than other forms of programming (<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2843393/application-development/functional-programming-tradeoffs-efficiency-learning-curve.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2843393/application-development/functional-programming-tradeoffs-efficiency-learning-curve.html</a>) and in theory should lead to smaller developer teams.</p>
<p>Even if you never use a pure functional programming language, the concepts are both very useful and widely adopted. You will probably be able to use functional programming concepts and techniques in your language of choice.</p>
<h2>Why Haskell?</h2>
<p>Functional programming is implemented in a range of other languages that aren&#8217;t purely functional, such as JavaScript, Erlang, Java v8+, Lisp, Ruby, while there are few purely functional languages (most notably, Miranda). Of these, Haskell is probably the best known pure functional programming language.</p>
<p>If you’re going to learn functional programming, why not go all the way and dive straight into a purely functional programming language?</p>
<h2>Learning it</h2>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>There are a number of good resources to learn functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Currently, Delft University of Technology offers a 6 week course that runs periodically through edX (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x">https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x</a>). This offers a comprehensive introduction to both functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is the book “Learn You A Haskell For Great Good” by Miran Lipovaca which can be bought or read online for free (<a href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/">http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Additionally, you can try it out online without downloading anything at a number of places, notable (<a href="https://tryhaskell.org/">https://tryhaskell.org/</a>) which offers a simple tutorial. When you are ready to dive in deeper, you can get the compiler source code or binaries from (<a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">https://www.haskell.org/platform/</a>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>Visual Basic (VB.net) &amp; ASP.net</ul>
<p>For a recent project I am dynamically binding a DropdDownList to a datasource (in this instance, a DataTable returned from SQL Server).</p>
<p>The user needed to see a series of formatted strings (the index column) in the DropDownList but I couldn&#8217;t find anything on how to do this. The index returned from the SQL database held the item number and I needed to transform that into &#8220;No.:xxxxxx&#8221; with five digits of zero-padding.</p>
<p>My first approach was to modify the DataTable prior to DataBinding by adding a column with an expression:</p>
<pre>DataTable.Columns.Add("FormattedIndex", Type.GetType("System.String"), "'No.:'+Index")</pre>
<p>(The third parameter is the expression).</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datacolumn.expression%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">DataTable Expression</a> property doesn&#8217;t have any functions for handling number-formatting.</p>
<p>The alternative and working solution was to modify the DropDownList via the DataBound method:</p>
<pre>Private Sub DropDownList_DataBound(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles DropDownList.DataBound
 'Rewrite text of items to include "No.:" prefix and 5-digit zero-padding
 For Each Item As ListItem In sender.Items
 Item.Text = String.Format("No.:{0:D5}", Integer.Parse(Item.Text))
 Next
End Sub</pre>
<p>And iterate through the ListItems being bound. One thing to note, many developers prefer to insert an item at index 0 with &#8220;Please Select&#8221; (as per):</p>
<pre>DropDownList.Items.Insert(0, New ListItem("Please Select", ""))</pre>
<p>This works fine with the above if DropDownList.DataBind() is called before the Insert()</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Node.js is a good web framework, especially when looking to build hugely-scalable applications that require little computation resources (think chat app or stock tracking for an entire stock exchange).</p>
<p>Node.js is a server side scripting platform in the JavaScript language. Learning it is also a good way to brush up on vanilla JavaScript. You&#8217;ll become much better at closures, IIFEs, anonymous functions, scope &amp; much more.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&#8217;ve ever asked yourself &#8220;should I use semicolons in Javascript?&#8221;, the answer is here: <a href="http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons">http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons</a> alternatively if you don&#8217;t only want to eat curry, then a great deal can be learnt about currying functions: <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/2011/functional-javascript-part-4-function-currying">http://tech.pro/tutorial/2011/functional-javascript-part-4-function-currying</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have just finished CS50x, Harvard&#8217;s online computer science offering. For my final project, I implemented a zoomable rendering of the Mandelbrot fractal, in Javascript, using the HTML5 canvas element.</p>
<p>The github repository is accessible at <a title="Github Repo for Mandelbrot Fractal" href="http://github.com/a2wd/mandelbrot">github.com/a2wd/mandelbrot<br />
</a></p>
<p>A live demonstration can be found at the attached github page, <a title="A live example of the Mandelbrot Javascript engine" href="http://a2wd.github.io/mandelbrot">a2wd.github.io/mandelbrot</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Fractals are fascinating and made for interesting research. The following are pages of note:</p>
<p>A general primer on fractals can be found at:</p>
<p><a title="Wikipedia article on Fractals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal</a></p>
<p>In particular, I thought to try the Mandelbrot set which is a fairly simple set of complex numbers</p>
<p><a title="Wikipedia article on the Mandelbrot set" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a></p>
<p>To plot the Mandelbrot set, we find the components of the imaginary numbers and mark how quickly the series diverges to infinity for any particular number along the complex plane:</p>
<p><a title="Wikipedia article on the complex plane" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane</a></p>
<h2>Example</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having recently made an update to my <a title="Respond WordPress Theme" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip">respond theme</a> for wordpress, I wanted to implement a mobile-targeted menu, taking into account that hover doesn&#8217;t work on smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>The two main options are an always-open menu or something triggered with javascript, whether that be a <a title="Select dropdown menu for mobile" href="http://css-tricks.com/convert-menu-to-dropdown/">select field</a>, a <a title="Dropdown mobile menu" href="http://astuteo.com/mobilemenu">dropdown</a> or a <a title="Berriart Sidr Menu - jQuery plugin" href="http://www.berriart.com/sidr/">slider</a>. Adopting a method of progressive enhancement, I load the page with the menu open and if javascript is enable then we can hide it and add an onClick() to a menu-toggle.</p>
<p>&#8230;But do we need to use jQuery for one onClick() event? Although the ~30kb load jQuery adds might not be that big a deal, especially if you have any pictures, it does mean an extra uri to fetch and wait for and the main reason for this is mobile which won&#8217;t necessarily have a fast or unlimited data connection.</p>
<p>It turns out I&#8217;m not the only one wondering this: <a title="You might not need jQuery" href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/</a></p>
<p>The javascript to implement this is dead easy so I opted to add it to the page via a script tag in the footer. You can get the updated theme from <a title="Respond wordpress theme" href="www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip">www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip</a>, and see <a title="Information on Respond wordpress theme" href="https://www.a2wd.com/updated-theme/">this post</a> for installation instructions.</p>
<p>Do I need jQuery?&#8230; Probably not.</p>

<a title="A perl module defining the postcode object used in postcode.pl" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/postcode.pm">postcode.pm</a><br />
<a title="A database of UK postcodes (out codes only) in CSV format" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/postcodes.csv">postcodes.csv</a></p>
<p>The perl script, <code>postcode.pl</code> takes input of two postcodes (spaces aren&#8217;t important either within the postcodes or between as I&#8217;ve used a <a title="A blog post on regular expressions" href="https://www.a2wd.com/8/">regular expression</a> to match them from the given command-line arguments) and returns the distance between the two in kilometers.</p>
<p>In this case I have used the <a title="The wikipedia article for the Haversine Law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">haversine law</a>, in contrast to my <a title="A blog post on coding in Visual Basic" href="http://www.a2wd.com/visual-basic-coding">previous work</a> in Visual Basic for Applications, which due to a rounding error in excel meant I had to drop back to <a title="The wikipedia article for Equirectangular Projections" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">Pythagoras&#8217; Law on Equiangular Projections</a></p>
<p>The usage is:</p>
<p><code>my $PostCode = new postcode(string $postcode1);<br />
my $distance = $PostCode-&gt;distanceTo(string $postcode2);</code></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the timesheets project, I have written a little jQuery clock plugin.</p>
<p>I wanted to show the current time on both the clocking-in &amp; out screens and also when registering/updating your profile.</p>
<p>The basic usage is:</p>
<p><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />
$("#clock_div").clock();<br />
&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>Which will transform</p>
<p><code>&lt;div id="clock_div"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>into this: <span id="clock" style="font-family:monospace; border:1px solid #cecece;">-Clock-</span></p>
<p>You can set the time format with:</p>
<p><code>format: 12 or 24</code></p>
<p>for instance:</p>
<p><code>$("#clock_div").clock({format:12});</code></p>
<p>although the default is for 24hr time.</p>
<p>Should work with versions of jQuery from 1.9.0+</p>
<p>Download the javascript here: <a title="Clock Plugin - Source Code" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/clock.js">clock.js</a></p>
<div><script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.a2wd.com/dl/clock.js"></script><br />
<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function(){
$("#clock").clock();
});
</script></div>
