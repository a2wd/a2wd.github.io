										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having recently made an update to my <a title="Respond WordPress Theme" href="http://www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip">respond theme</a> for wordpress, I wanted to implement a mobile-targeted menu, taking into account that hover doesn&#8217;t work on smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>The two main options are an always-open menu or something triggered with javascript, whether that be a <a title="Select dropdown menu for mobile" href="http://css-tricks.com/convert-menu-to-dropdown/">select field</a>, a <a title="Dropdown mobile menu" href="http://astuteo.com/mobilemenu">dropdown</a> or a <a title="Berriart Sidr Menu - jQuery plugin" href="http://www.berriart.com/sidr/">slider</a>. Adopting a method of progressive enhancement, I load the page with the menu open and if javascript is enable then we can hide it and add an onClick() to a menu-toggle.</p>
<p>&#8230;But do we need to use jQuery for one onClick() event? Although the ~30kb load jQuery adds might not be that big a deal, especially if you have any pictures, it does mean an extra uri to fetch and wait for and the main reason for this is mobile which won&#8217;t necessarily have a fast or unlimited data connection.</p>
<p>It turns out I&#8217;m not the only one wondering this: <a title="You might not need jQuery" href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/</a></p>
<p>The javascript to implement this is dead easy so I opted to add it to the page via a script tag in the footer. You can get the updated theme from <a title="Respond wordpress theme" href="www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip">www.a2wd.com/dl/respond.zip</a>, and see <a title="Information on Respond wordpress theme" href="https://a2wd.github.io/updated-theme/">this post</a> for installation instructions.</p>
<p>Do I need jQuery?&#8230; Probably not.</p>

		<title>LESS &#038; Stylesheets</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having used a couple of different web design frameworks, I&#8217;d come across LESS but had not taken the time to properly understand it till now and really, can&#8217;t understand why it wasn&#8217;t till 2009 that it appeared (or 2007, for the original, SASS).</p>
<p>The website for the language is at <a title="LESS CSS Website" href="http://www.lesscss.org/">http://www.lesscss.org/</a> though for a really good overview, I can recommend the <a title="LESS Wikipedia Article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LESS_(stylesheet_language)">wikipedia article on LESS</a>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, with CSS you&#8217;ll be repeating the same thing again and again. For instance:</p>
<p><code>#header<br />
{<br />
background-color:#fcfcfc;<br />
color:#313131;<br />
}<br />
h1<br />
{<br />
background-color:#fcfcfc;<br />
color:#313131;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>but with LESS you can just use a variable:</p>
<p><code>@bg: #fcfcfc;<br />
@fg: #313131;</code></p>
<p><code>#header<br />
{<br />
background-color: @bg;<br />
color: @fg;<br />
}<br />
h1<br />
{<br />
background-color: @bg;<br />
color: @fg;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>Repeated over a whole stylesheet, this can lead to considerable savings in space and coding time. It also means that changing all the colours in one go is as simple as changing the variable.</p>
<p>The other main features worth noting are <strong>mixins</strong>, where you can embed a whole set of properties into different CSS rules and the ability to use algebra in setting values.</p>
<p>A LESS stylesheet can&#8217;t be read by a browser but can be interpreted either client-side or server-side by javascript code in the browser or a program on the web server, though for speed, in a production setting I would opt for compiling and minifying before release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This website is responsive. There is one version of the content and depending on the size of your screen, it will render differently. If you&#8217;re browsing on a pc, try it now &#8211; stretch and shrink the width.</p>
<p>This is the future of the web and it&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>As a web designer it&#8217;s important to consider your audience and how they&#8217;ll be accessing your site.  Last year (2013), 15% of internet users were accessing the web from mobile devices, according to a report published by consultancy KPCB.</p>
<p>Mobile internet access will rise and as cheaper phones and networks allow more citiens of developing countries to access the internet on mobile, this trend will become exaggerated.</p>
<p>Mobile design is important because the experience on a phone or tablet is so different from the desktop where a mouse and keyboard are to hand. The Mashable article linked to below highlights a number of ideas to follow but I think the key to building a good design is for a rapid testing-feedback loop and trying out the site on as many different devices as possible.</p>
