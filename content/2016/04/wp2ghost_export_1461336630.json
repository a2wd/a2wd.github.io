For instance:\n\n```\n#header<br><\/br>\n{<br><\/br>\nbackground-color:#fcfcfc;<br><\/br>\ncolor:#313131;<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>\nh1<br><\/br>\n{<br><\/br>\nbackground-color:#fcfcfc;<br><\/br>\ncolor:#313131;<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nbut with LESS you can just use a variable:\n\n```\n@bg: #fcfcfc;<br><\/br>\n@fg: #313131;```\n\n```\n#header<br><\/br>\n{<br><\/br>\nbackground-color: @bg;<br><\/br>\ncolor: @fg;<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>\nh1<br><\/br>\n{<br><\/br>\nbackground-color: @bg;<br><\/br>\ncolor: @fg;<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nRepeated over a whole stylesheet, this can lead to considerable savings in space and coding time.
